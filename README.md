## Please take a look at the projects that I have developed or am working on:
###   - [Tax Form 2106:](https://github.com/skipmcgee/2106) (***In Progress***) An application to assist and enable reserve / national guard personel filling out tax form 2106.
###   - [weatherscraper:](https://github.com/skipmcgee/weatherscraper) GUI application to display the current weather in two locations. Requires a free API key.
###   - [expense analysis:](https://github.com/skipmcgee/expense_impact) A quick coding exercise to try to teach python basics and help guide personal finance decisions. 
###   - [host security:](https://github.com/skipmcgee/host_security) This is the first script that I ever wrote - it definitely isn't the best-written code you will see, but it works and helps ensure the continuous monitoring of your environment.

***I would love to get your feedback and improve the quality and caliber of my code!***
