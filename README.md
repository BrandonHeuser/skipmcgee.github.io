## Please take a look at the projects that I have completed or are currently working on:
- [Tax Form 2106:](https://github.com/skipmcgee/2106) (***In Progress***) An application to assist and enable reserve / national guard personel filling out tax form 2106.
- [weatherscraper:](https://github.com/skipmcgee/weatherscraper) (***In Progress***) A GUI application to display the current weather in two locations. Requires a free API key.
- [expense analysis:](https://github.com/skipmcgee/expense_impact) (***Completed***) A quick coding exercise to try to teach python basics while helping guide personal finance decisions. 
- [host security:](https://github.com/skipmcgee/host_security) (***Completed***) This is the first script that I ever wrote - it definitely isn't the best-written code you will see, but it works and helps ensure the continuous monitoring of your environment. Enumerate security-relevant information on your RHEL 6 & 7 hosts and send it via syslog to your enterprise logserver.

***I would love to get your feedback and improve the quality and caliber of my code!***
