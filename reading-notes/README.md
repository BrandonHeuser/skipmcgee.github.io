# *Hello!*

***My name is Skip McGee, I'm a growing and learning software developer!***

## To me, a "growth mindset" means focusing on continuous improvement. This is a diligent, daily practice that requires internal evaluation and assessment.
## Three ways that I can maintain a growth mindset:
  - Active Listening
  - Ask frequent, genuine questions
  - Diligently work to understand, failure to prepare is failure to grow

## Please check out my [main](https://github.com/skipmcgee/skipmcgee.github.io) GitHub page and my [code](https://github.com/skipmcgee).

***I would love to get your feedback and improve the quality and caliber of my code!***
